# Abstract
**Introduction** The effect of infant nutrition on long-term cognition is important for parents and policy makers. However, most clinical trials typically have short follow-up periods, when measures of cognition are poorly predictive of later function. The few trials with longer-term follow-up have high levels of attrition, which can lead to selection bias, and in turn to erroneous interpretation of long-term harms and benefits of infant nutrition. We address the need for unbiased, long-term follow-up, by linking measures of educational performance from administrative education records. Educational performance is a meaningful marker of cognitive function in children and it is strongly correlated with IQ. We aim to evaluate educational performance for children who, as infants, were part of a series of trials that randomised participants to either nutritionally modified infant formula or standard formula. Most trialists anticipated positive effects of these interventions on later cognitive function.

**Methods** and analysis Using data from 1923 participants of seven randomised infant formula trials linked to the English National Pupil Database (NPD), this study will provide new insights into the effect of nutrient intake in infancy on school achievement. Our primary outcome will be the mean differences in z-scores between intervention and control groups for a compulsory Mathematics exam sat at age 16. Secondary outcomes will be z-scores for a compulsory English exam at age 16 and z-scores for compulsory Mathematics and English exams at age 11. We will also evaluate intervention effects on the likelihood of receiving special educational needs (SEN) support. All analyses will be performed separately by trial.

# Ethics approval and legal basis for data processing
The proposal to link the trials and NHS data underwent a robust ethical, legal and technical review. The proposed project was approved by the UCL Research and Development Office and Data Protection Office (Reference: 14PE15), the NHS London-City and East Research Ethics Committee (Reference: 17/LO/0556) as well as the Health Research Authority and Health and Care Research Wales (Reference: 212148). An exemption under Section 251 of the NHS Act 2006 was granted by the Confidentiality Advisory Group (Reference: 17CAG0051) and allows UCL GOS ICH and the FFT to process identifiable participant information to facilitate the data linkage and analyses without consent. Dissent and fair processing were discussed with the HRA CAG and an opt-out procedure is in place.
